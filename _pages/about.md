I am currently an Associate Researcher at Shenzhen University. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2016 and my Ph.D. in the same field from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021. Following my Ph.D., I served as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2021. I was recognized with several awards, including the Outstanding Graduate Student Award.

My research interests span a wide range of areas, including Natural Language Processing, Biomedical Informatics, Machine Learning, Relation Extraction, Gene-Protein Interaction Extraction, Software Testing, and Root Cause Localization. My work has been published in various prestigious international conferences and journals, such as IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, ESEC/FSE, BMC Bioinformatics, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, and BIBM.

I have actively participated in major research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for several international journals, including the International Journal of Biomedical Data Mining.

I am dedicated to advancing computer science and biomedical informatics through innovative research and collaboration.
